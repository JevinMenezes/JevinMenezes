Hello there! I'm Jevin.

* Working as a Software Developer for an Insurance domain customer of [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com)
  * As a member of Application Security module I actively contribute towards the security framework of the project
  * I collaborate with the other teams for the web application issue analysis, debugging, resolution and thereby provide support till the fixes are released
  * I also play the role of an Information Security Analyst for enhancements which require thorough InfoSec review, risk mitigation and signoffs
  * Once in 3 months I work with Performance monitoring team to enhance overall application performance metrics
